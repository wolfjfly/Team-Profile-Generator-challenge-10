# Team-Profile-Generator-challenge-10
  
  ## Description
  AS A manager
  I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
  SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

  GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input<br>
  WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information<br>
  THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input<br>
  WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML<br>
  THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address<br>
  WHEN I click on the GitHub username<br>
  THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab<br>
  WHEN I start the application<br>
  THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number<br>
  WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number<br>
  THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team<br>
  WHEN I select the engineer option<br>
  THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu<br>
  WHEN I select the intern option<br>
  THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu<br>
  WHEN I decide to finish building my team<br>
  THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated<br>
